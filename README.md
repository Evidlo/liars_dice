# liars_dice
Liar's Dice simulator written in Python

Define your bots under the section ### BOTS ###
Bots are called every turn and are passed the game parameters in a dict with the following structure

 {'players':[
        {'bet':(number_of_die,die_value),'num_die':number_of_player_die},
        {'bet':(number_of_die,die_value),'num_die':number_of_player_die},
        {'bet':None,'num_die':6}
        ],
  'previous_id':previous_player_id,
  'previous_bet':(number_of_die,die_value),
  'current_id':active_player_id,
  'your_id':your_id,
  'your_rolls':[6,5,4,3,2,1],
  'game_over':0
}


Your bot should return a tuple ('number of dice','value') to bet, 'bluff' or 'spot on'.
Your response is ignored when it is not your turn.
